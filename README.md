# shopify-redirect
Show a popup to US visitors to your Shopify store and give them button options to be redirected, or continue shopping on the Canadian website.

Obviously this will work with any Country code, you just need to Google for specific country codes. For example, if it was Australia in your situation, you'd use AU instead of US, etc etc...
